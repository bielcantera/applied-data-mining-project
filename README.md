# Applied Data Mining & Machine Learning Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a complete **applied data mining workflow**, focusing on exploratory analysis, feature preparation, and comparative evaluation of multiple machine learning classification models.

Rather than building a production pipeline, the goal of this project is to **understand the data, extract meaningful patterns, and evaluate model behavior** using standard data mining and machine learning techniques.

The project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and follows a structured, methodical approach aligned with real-world analytical practice.

## Objectives
- Explore and understand the structure and quality of the dataset
- Apply data preprocessing and feature transformation techniques
- Train and compare multiple supervised classification models
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Draw conclusions about model suitability and data characteristics

## Methodology

### 1. Data Exploration
- Inspection of dataset dimensions and feature types
- Analysis of missing values and distributions
- Initial insights into class balance and feature behavior

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning and handling missing or inconsistent values
- Feature selection and transformation
- Preparation of data for machine learning models

### 3. Modeling
Multiple supervised learning algorithms are trained and evaluated, following a consistent experimental setup.  
This allows for a fair comparison between different modeling approaches and highlights their respective strengths and weaknesses.

### 4. Evaluation
- Model performance is assessed using standard classification metrics
- Results are compared to identify trade-offs between accuracy, robustness, and interpretability
